# JMH template
This is a minimal, ready-to-use project for benchmarking with JMH - https://github.com/openjdk/jmh.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FriskIsGit/JMH-template
```

### Maven
This template includes **Maven wrapper**, `mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd` wrapper scripts.
`mvnw.cmd` was modified to prevent a powershell syntax error tied to `maven-wrapper.jar` download (if it's missing).
